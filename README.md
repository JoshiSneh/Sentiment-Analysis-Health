# Mental Health Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on mental health-related statements using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains statements related to mental health, each labeled with a corresponding mental health status.

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify mental health-related statements into different categories such as Normal, Depression, Anxiety, Suicidal thoughts, etc. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing including text cleaning and lemmatization
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Logistic Regression model for multi-class classification
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80.59% on the test set.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms
- Implement deep learning models like LSTM or BERT
- Perform more advanced feature engineering
- Collect more data to improve model performance
